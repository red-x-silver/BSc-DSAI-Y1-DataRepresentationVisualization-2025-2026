  <div> Data, representation and visualization! </div>

  <div> What is data? 😶‍🌫️ </div>

  <div>
    Got a question for you: 
     <br /> 
    "when I think about data, I'm thinking of...?"
  </div>

    <div>
    When I think about data, I'm thinking of...
    <br /> 
    - that thing I pay for as part of my monthly phone contract 😶‍🌫️
  </div>

      <div>
    When I think about data, I'm thinking of...
    <br /> 
    - a spreadsheet of rows and columns, displayed within the green-ish Excel interface 🧩
  </div>

        <div>
    When I think about data, I'm thinking of...
    <br /> 
    - information about me and my user behaviour on Facebook, Instagram, ChatGPT... 😎
  </div>
  

        <div>
    When I think about data, I'm thinking of...
   <br />
    - the recorded observation that scientists made from physics experiments, e.g. <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/old-large-hadron-collider">the large hadron collider in CERN </a>   
  </div>

  <div>  
  <h3>These are all data!</h3>
  <p>In fact, they represent different perspectives about data: </p>
  <p> - data in phone📱: digital, quantized for easy measurement (e.g. 250GB) </p>
  <p> - data in a spreadsheet📋: structured, note that not all data can be put into rows and columns  </p>
  <p> - data about me on social media🧃: behavioural data, include more than just numbers (e.g. the images I have uploaded)</p>
  <p> - data from scientific experiments🔬: natural data, comes from observation </p>
  <p> - - - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RF09G8Ymqg">and I'm still gaining new understanding about data... </a>  </p>
  </div>

 <div> <a href="https://resources.data.gov/glossary/data-vs.-information/"> How about data vs. information - what is the difference? </a>  </div>
  
  
  
   <div> What can people do with data? 😶‍🌫️ 
     <br />
   - In most cases people have some questions or hypothesises in mind, and then go discover the related patterns from the data to answer the questions!
      <br />
   - - <a href="https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/course/section.php?id=573047">("how to form a research question" on page52-55 in Kayal's slides from week 4)</a>  
      <br />
    - The discovered patterns can be analyzed, visualized and present to others.   
   </div>

   <div> Let's browse this data science platform called <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"> Kaggle </a> to see what data there are and what questions people try to ask from data </div>

  <div> any questions so far? </div>


   <div> Let's move on to the next keyword in our unit title: 
      <br />
     what is representation?
   </div>

  <div> Quick Quiz 00: What is apple? 🍎  </div>
  
  <div> Quick Quiz 01
  <br /> 
  How do you distinguish apple as a fruit vs. Apple as a tech company? 
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    Here are some possible representations:
  <br /> 
    - is it edible or not?
  <br /> 
    - is it a fruit?
   <br />
    - is the word spelled with an upper cased "A"? 🤪    
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    Quick Quiz 02
    <br />    
    How do you distinguish apple vs. pear?  🍎🍏🍐       
  </div>
      
  <div> 
    How do you distinguish apple vs. pear?  🍎🍏🍐
    <br />   
    Do any of our previous representations work?
    <br /> 
    - is it edible or not?
    <br /> 
    - is it a fruit?
    <br />
    - is the word spelled with an upper cased "A"? 🤪    
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    No but here are some possible representations:
    <br /> 
    - their shapes
    <br />
    - their tastes   
  </div>
  
  
  <div> 
    Good representation simplifies our task!
    <br /> 
    To excel at pattern discovery from data ~= To find a good representation

  </div>
  
  <div> 
   Representation can be contextual.
   <br /> 
   Depends on the problem context, different tasks may have different efficient representations for the same objects.
  </div>
  
  
  <div> Takeaway messages on representation:
     <br /> 
    - It can be descriptive and capture some characteristics.
     <br /> 
    - It can be perspective and partial. 
     <br /> 
    - It can be contextual where "good" ones are task-dependent.

  </div>
  <div> any questions so far? </div>


  <div> Till now we have been using English words to describe representations. 📙
     <br /> 
    How about using machine-readable words (numbers) to represent objects, concepts, etc.? 🤖
  </div>
  
  
  <div> Numbers and Numeric representation </div>
  
  <div> 
     What do we use (real) numbers for?
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    - To count things
     <br />    
    - To measure things
      <br />   
    - To label things
      <br />

  A side note:
  <br /> 
  - Do we really have numbers in the real world? Have you seen numbers walking on the street on their own?
  </div>
  
  <div> 
  A side note:
  <br /> 
  Have you seen numbers walking on the street on their own?
  <br />
  - Numbers are often used with contexts. To connect numbers with reality, we always need interpretation guide(e.g. a protocol, unit, etc.) when using numbers in real life. 
  <br />
  - How to interpret numbers produced by computer programms is a helpful skill you can get from this unit.

  </div>
  
  <div> 
  Why are numbers important?
     <br />    
    - All digital systems have to use numbers and numbers only to store and process data. It's the digital system, as opposed to the analog system, that is almost everywhere nowadays - phones, computers, servers, your smart glasses in the future, etc.
    <br /> 
    - Numbers can introduce maths, which is our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmvkhLz8t7I">DOMAIN EXPANSION 💥</a>

  <div> Recap on "data modality"</div>

  <div> 
    Data modalities🕶️
     <br />    
    Information that we can gather from the world and store in digital systems as "data", are mainly from four modalities:
      <br />   
    - 👁️Image (picture, video)
      <br />   
    - 📝Text (written language)
      <br />   
    - 🎵Audio (music, speech)
      <br />   
    - 🧩Tabular(this week's weather in degree celsius, everyone's birthday in this class, sensor data, etc.)
      <br />  
      Can you think of any information that is not from the four categories?
  </div>
  
    <div> 
    🧠 My mind-blowing moment:
      <br />   
    - Information from any of those three categories (image, text and audio) can be digitized / numberified aka be represented by just a bunch of numbers.
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    Data modalities🕶️
     <br />    
    - Each data modality has its own characteristics and challenges for representation, processing and analysis.
      <br />
     - We structure our next few lectures based on the different data modalities, each week focusing on one modality (with a few exceptions).
      <br />
  </div>

    <div>
      Data modalities covered in the weeks to come:
      <br />
    - Week 6: Tabular data, represented and visualized with Python
    <br /> 
    - Week 7: Image data, represented and visualized with Python 
    <br /> 
    - Week 8: Text data, represented and visualized with Python
    <br /> 
    - Week 9: Audio data, represented and visualized with Python
  </div>

 <div> What is Python? 🐍
   <br /> 
 - Python is a versatile, high-level, and interpreted programming language known for its simple syntax, making it easy to read and learn.
 </div>

   <div> What can we do with Python? 🐍
   <br /> 
 - Python is a general-purpose language used to create a range of applications, including data science, AI development, software and web development, and more.
   </div>

     <div> Have you used Python before? 🐍
   <br /> 
 - No worries if not! Let's start from scratch ;)
   </div>

     <div> With Python being the programming language, 
   <br /> 
 - we need an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q3tw7sc1ZA">IDE</a>, a place to write and run code with.
   </div> 
  
  <div> Today we will use "Google Colab Notebook" for writing and running Python code. 
   <br /> 
 - It is a web-based IDE with NICE features! 
   </div>
  
 <div>
    ✋Next, we are going to:
    <br />
    - take our first look at the google colab notebook!
    <br />
    - learn some very simple python basics!
  </div>

  <div>
    <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1czJaQi4ng3xa7pCcemHjyq2qCQEKIvGO?usp=sharing"> A prepared google
      colab notebook </a>
    <br /> 1. click on the link and open this google colab notebook
  </div>

  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:75% 25%;'>
    <img src='https://cdn.glitch.global/60e0bb7c-c728-41a2-965e-d0ee626232b0/notebook1.png?v=1697479338383' />
    <div> 2. Open it in playground or save a copy to your google drive (recommended) </div>
  </div>


  <div>
    Demystify google colab notebook
    <br />
    Two types of cells ✌️
    <br /> - Text cell
    <br /> -- It is for passing information to other people reading the notebook.
    <br /> -- just like comment in swift, but with better layout.
    <br /> - Code cell:
    <br /> -- It is the actual programming part.
    <br /> -- It has a play button at the top left corner. ▶️
  </div>

    <div> Without explaining what the code is doing, here is a screenshot of a code cell and its output </div>
  </div>

  <div> How would you distinguish a code cell from a text cell? </div>

  <div> How would you distinguish a code cell from a text cell?
    <br /> - Code cells have grey-ish background.
    <br /> - Code cells have run buttons at the top left corner when you hover over.

  </div>

  <div>
    Let's take a look at the notebook!
    <br />

    <br /> - 1. Make sure you have saved a copy to your GDrive or opened in playground.
    <br /> - 2. Read all text cells and code cells one by one.
    <br /> - 3. Run all code cells and don't forget to read the comments in code cells.
    <br /> - 4. Ignore stuff after the text "This is the end of week 4"

  </div>

  <div> Little tasks 🌶️🌶️:
    <br /> - Add a text cell at the beginning of notebook and write down your name and your mood of the day 😈
    <br /> - Add a code cell below that text cell and write two lines of code:
    <br /> -- 1. Create a variable named "greetings" and assign a string value "bello" to it
    <br /> -- 2. Print the variable greetings using print(greetings)
    <br /> -- 3. Run the cell!!!
  </div>


  <div> That's quite a lot, congrats! 🎉 </div>


  <div> Now let's advance to <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ynS6VfkIWeRHpE_twvm-SnLUt__OZV02?usp=sharing"> the next notebook
      with python basics 01 </a>
  </div>



  <div> - Let's take a look at the notebook cell-by-cell till "Functions (week 5)"(excluded)
    <br /> - Don't forget to make a copy to your GDirve 🎉
    <br /> - We are not expected to memorise the syntax.
    <br /> - The goal is to familiarise ourselves with the concept of:
    <br /> -- basic arithmetic in python 🧮
    <br /> -- lists in python 🧺
    <br /> -- strings in python 🔤
    <br /> -- conditionals in python ❓
    <br /> -- loops in python 🌀
