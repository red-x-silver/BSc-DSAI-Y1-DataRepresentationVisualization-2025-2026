  <div> What is this unit about? </div>

  <div> Data, representation and visualization! </div>

  <div> What is data? 😶‍🌫️ </div>

  <div>
    Got a question for you: 
     <br /> 
    "when I think about data, I'm thinking of...?"
  </div>

    <div>
    When I think about data, I'm thinking of...
    <br /> 
    - that thing I pay for as part of my monthly phone contract 😶‍🌫️
  </div>

      <div>
    When I think about data, I'm thinking of...
    <br /> 
    - that thing I pay for as part of my monthly phone contract 😶‍🌫️
    <br /> 
    - a spreadsheet of rows and columns, displayed within the green-ish Excel interface 🧩
  </div>

        <div>
    When I think about data, I'm thinking of...
    <br /> 
    - that thing I pay for as part of my monthly phone contract 😶‍🌫️
    <br /> 
    - a spreadsheet of rows and columns, displayed within the green-ish Excel interface 🧩
    <br /> 
    - information about me and my user behaviour on Facebook, Instagram, ChatGPT... 😎
    <br />
    - the recorded observation that scientists made from physics experiments, e.g. <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/old-large-hadron-collider">the large hadron collider in CERN </a>   
  </div>

  <div>  
  <h3>These are all data!</h3>
  <p>In fact, they represent different perspectives about data: </p>
  <p> - data in phone📱: digital, quantized for easy measurement (e.g. 250GB) </p>
  <p> - data in a spreadsheet📋: structured, note that not all data can be put into rows and columns  </p>
  <p> - data about me on social media🧃: behavioural data, include more than just numbers (e.g. the images I have uploaded)</p>
  <p> - data from scientific experiments🔬: natural data, comes from observation </p>
  <p> - - - and I'm still gaining new understanding about data... </p>
  </div>

 <div> How about data vs. information - what is the difference? </div>
  
  <div> Some definition about data and information </div>

  
  
   <div> What can people do with data? 😶‍🌫️ 
     <br />
   - In most cases people have some questions or hypothesises in mind, and then go discover the related patterns from the data to answer the questions!
      <br />
   - See Kayal's slides on how to have a research question
      <br />
    - The discovered patterns are visualized, present, or turned in to an audio-visual art work sometimes.

  <div> any questions so far? </div>


   <div> Let's move on to the next keyword in our unit title: 
      <br />
     what is representation?
   </div>

  <div> What is apple </div>
  
  <div> Quick Quiz 01
  <br /> 
  How do you distinguish apple as a fruit vs. Apple as a tech company? 
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    Here are some possible representations:
  <br /> 
    - is it edible or not?
  <br /> 
    - is it a fruit?
   <br />
    - is the word spelled with an upper cased "A"? 🤪    
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    Quick Quiz 02
    <br />    
    How do you distinguish apple vs. pear?  🍎🍏🍐       
  </div>
      
  <div> 
    How do you distinguish apple vs. pear?  🍎🍏🍐
    <br />   
    Do any of our previous representations work?
    <br /> 
    - is it edible or not?
    <br /> 
    - is it a fruit?
    <br />
    - is the word spelled with an upper cased "A"? 🤪    
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    No but here are some possible representations:
    <br /> 
    - their shapes
    <br />
    - their tastes   
  </div>
  
  
  <div> 
    Good representation simplifies our task!
    <br /> 
    To excel at pattern discovery from data ~= To find a good representation

  </div>
  
  <div> 
   Representation can be contextual.
   <br /> 
   Depends on the problem context, different tasks may have different efficient representations for the same objects.
  </div>
  
  
  <div> Takeaway message on representation:
     <br /> 
    - It can be descriptive and capture some characteristics.
     <br /> 
    - It can be perspective and partial. 
     <br /> 
    - It can be contextual where "good" ones are task-dependent.

  <div> any questions so far? </div>

  <div> - A side note on abstraction (in the context of computational thinking) -
   <br /> 
   Abstraction is related to representation in the sense that    
   it is about taking away irrelevant details and reducing the representation to essential characteristics.
   <br /> 
   (Shoutout to  <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DiplomaInAppleDevelopment-AutumnWinter2022/codingOne/lecture_01.html#42">Joel's slides</a> on "what is computational thinking?")
  </div>
 
  <div> Till now we have been using English words to describe representations. 📙
     <br /> 
    How about using machine words (numbers) to represent objects, concepts, etc.? 🤖
  </div>
  
  
  <div> any questions so far? </div>
  
  <div> Numbers and Numeric representation </div>
  
  <div> 
     What do we use (real) numbers for?
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    - To count things
     <br />    
    - To measure things
      <br />   
    - To label things

  A side note:
  <br /> 
  - Do we really have numbers in the real world? Have you seen numbers walking on the street on their own?
  </div>

  A side note:
  <br /> 
  Have you seen numbers walking on the street on their own?
  <br />
  - Numbers are often used with contexts. To connect numbers with reality, we always need interpretation guide(e.g. a protocol, unit, etc.) when using numbers in real life. 
  <br />
  - How to interpret numbers produced by computer programms is a helpful skill you can get from this unit.

  </div>
  
  <div> 
  Why are numbers important?
     <br />    
    - All digital systems have to use numbers and numbers only to store and process data. It's the digital system, as opposed to the analog system, that is almost everywhere nowadays - phones, computers, servers, your smart glasses in the future, etc.
    <br /> 
    - Numbers can introduce maths, which is our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmvkhLz8t7I">DOMAIN EXPANSION 💥</a>

  <div> Recap on "data modality"</div>

  <div> 
    Data modalities🕶️
     <br />    
    Information that we can gather from the world and store in digital systems as "data", are mainly from four modalities:
      <br />   
    - 👁️Image (picture, video)
      <br />   
    - 📝Text (written language)
      <br />   
    - 🎵Audio (music, speech)
      <br />   
    - 🧩Tabular(this week's weather in degree celsius, everyone's birthday in this class, sensor data, etc.)
      <br />  
      Can you think of any information that is not from the four categories?
  </div>
  
    <div> 
    🧠 My mind-blowing moment:
      <br />   
    - Information from any of those three categories (image, text and audio) can be digitized / numberified aka be represented by just a bunch of numbers.
  </div>
  
  <div> 
    Data modalities🕶️
     <br />    
    - Each data modality has its own characteristics and challenges for representation, processing and analysis.
      <br />
     - We structure our next few lectures based on the different data modalities, each week focusing on one modality (with a few exceptions).
      <br />
  </div>

    <div>
      Modalities covered in the weeks to come:
      <br />
    - Week 6: Tabular data
    <br /> 
    - Week 7: Image data 
    <br /> 
    - Week 8: Text data
    <br /> 
    - Week 9: Audio data
